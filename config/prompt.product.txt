Goal: extract a minimal product payload (title + price) from a Shopee product page as fast as possible.

Task:
1) Navigate to this Shopee product URL: {{URL}}
2) Wait until the page is ready:
   - document.readyState === "complete", AND
   - a product title is present OR a visible price is present OR page contains embedded product JSON/state.
3) Detect blocking walls early:
   - If the page shows login / verification / CAPTCHA (e.g., "登入", "登錄", "驗證", "captcha", "robot", slider verification),
     return status="needs_manual" with notes explaining what you saw.
4) Extract data (minimal):
   - Prefer embedded JSON/state if it is easy to access; otherwise use DOM text.
   - Extract:
     - product title (string)
     - sale price (number or numeric string; if a range is shown, use the minimum)
     - currency (string, e.g., "TWD") if visible/obvious; otherwise omit.

Output contract (JSON ONLY, no markdown, no extra keys):
{
  "url": "string",
  "status": "ok | needs_manual | error",
  "captured_at": "ISO-8601 UTC timestamp",
  "notes": "string (required when status=needs_manual)",
  "error": "string (required when status=error)",
  "title": "string",
  "price": "number or numeric string",
  "currency": "string (optional, e.g., TWD)"
}

Rules:
- If status="ok": include title and price (and currency when obvious).
- If status="needs_manual": include notes describing the wall.
- If status="error": include error (string) with the failure reason.
- Normalize price:
  - Strip currency symbols, commas, spaces; keep only digits and an optional decimal point.
  - If the page shows a range, use the minimum.
