You are controlling an already-running Google Chrome via Chrome DevTools.

Goal: extract ONLY the product title and sale price from a Shopee product page as fast as possible.

Performance rules (important):
- Minimize tool round-trips: prefer 1 navigation + 1 evaluate_script call total.
- Do NOT scroll the whole page, do NOT take screenshots unless blocked.
- Do NOT scan the entire DOM; use a few targeted selectors + meta tags.

Task:
1) Navigate to this Shopee product URL: {{URL}}
2) Wait until the page is ready:
   - document.readyState === "complete", AND
   - EITHER a title is present (meta/h1) OR a price-like string is present in the page text.
3) Extract data in ONE evaluate_script (keep it simple and fast):
   - Detect blocking walls early:
     - If you see login / verification / CAPTCHA (e.g., "登入", "登錄", "驗證", "captcha", "robot", slider verification),
       return status="needs_manual" with notes describing what you saw.
   - Title (prefer stable sources, in this order):
     1) `meta[property="og:title"]`
     2) visible `main h1` (fallback `h1`)
     3) `document.title` (last resort)
     - Clean title: trim + collapse repeated whitespace.
   - Price (prefer stable sources, in this order):
     1) `meta[property="product:price:amount"]` (fallback other price-ish meta like `meta[itemprop="price"]`)
     2) A price-like string found in the page text (regex for `NT$`/`$` + digits); if a range is shown, take the minimum.
     - Avoid crossed-out prices: ignore text inside `<del>/<s>` and ignore elements with computed `textDecorationLine` containing `"line-through"`.
   - If the page is not blocked and you still cannot get a non-empty `title` OR a valid `price`,
     return status="error" with a short reason (what was missing).

Output contract (JSON ONLY, no markdown):
{
  "url": "string",
  "status": "ok | needs_manual | error",
  "captured_at": "ISO-8601 UTC timestamp",
  "notes": "string (required when status=needs_manual)",
  "error": "string (required when status=error)",
  "title": "string",
  "price": "number or numeric string"
}

Rules:
- If status="ok": include title and price.
- If status="needs_manual": include notes describing the wall.
- If status="error": include error (string) with the failure reason.
- Do NOT output placeholder type-descriptions like "string" as values; output real values with correct JSON types.
- Normalize price:
  - Strip currency symbols, commas, spaces; keep only digits and an optional decimal point.
  - If the page shows a range, use the minimum.
